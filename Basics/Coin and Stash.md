## Coin

**Coin** is an abstract measure of cash and liquid assets.

The few bits PCs use in their daily lives are not tracked. If a character wants to spend to achieve a small goal (bribe a doorman), use the PC's **lifestyle quality** for a fortune roll.

## Monetary values

* **1 coin**: A full purse of silver pieces. A week's wages.
* **2 coin**: A fine weapon. A weekly income for a small business. A fine piece of art. A set of luxury clothes.
* **4 coin**: A satchel full of silver. A month's wages.
* **6 coin**: An exquisite jewel. A heavy burden of silver pieces.
* **8 coin**: A good monthly take for a small business. A small safe full of coins and valuables. A very rare luxury commodity.
* **10 coin**: Liquidating a significant asset—a carriage and goats, a horse, a deed to a small property.

More than 4**coin** is an impractical amount to keep lying around. You must spend the excess or put it in your **stash** (see below). A crew can also store 4 **coin** in their lair, by default. If they upgrade to a **vault**, they can expand their stores to **8** and then **16** **coin**. Any **coin** beyond their limit must be spent as soon as possible (typically before the next score) or distributed among the crew members.

One unit of **coin** in silver pieces or other bulk currency takes up one item slot for your **load** when carried.

### Coin Use

* Spend 1 **coin** to get an additional **activity** during **downtime**.
* Spend 1 **coin** to increase the result level of a **downtime activity** roll.
* Spend **coin** to avoid certain crew **entanglements**.
* Put **coin** in your character's **stash** to improve their lifestyle and circumstances when they retire. See the next section.
* Spend **coin** when you advance your crew's **Tier**.

## Stash & Retirement

When you mark your character's final **trauma** and they retire, the amount of **coin** they've managed to stash away determines their fate. Your stash tracker is on your character sheet.

* **Stash 0-10:** **Poor soul.** You end up in the gutter, awash in vice and misery.
* **Stash 11-20: Meager.** A tiny hovel that you can call your own.
* **Stash 21-39: Modest.** A simple home or apartment, with some small comforts. You might operate a tavern or small business.
* **Stash 40: Fine.** A well-appointed home or apartment, claiming a few luxuries. You might operate a medium business.

In addition, each full row of stash (10 **coins**) indicates the **quality level of the character's lifestyle**, from zero (street life) to four (luxury).

> Cross wants some alone-time with a prospective new friend, but he can't take them back to the hidden lair where he lives, so what to do? Ryan, Cross's player, says he wants to rent a nice room for the evening, so the GM asks for a fortune roll using Cross's lifestyle rating to see what quality of room Cross can manage.

### Removing coin from your stash

If you want to pull **coin** out of your stash, you may do so, at a cost. Your character sells off some of their assets and investments in order to get some quick cash. **For every 2 stash removed, you get 1 ****coin**** in cash.**
