You live in a starship that has been in flight for hundreds of years, but is still hundreds of years from its destination. You are besieged by ghosts, and if the ship has to hold any more people you'll be running out of air. You will die here. But that doesn't mean you can't die wealthy.

Life on board a starship is not a peaceful utopian existence. It is often nasty, brutish and short. Despite that, it binds people toward a common purpose. Your characters will die; it happens. Your crews may dissolve; crews come and go. But none of that will matter if you run out of air.


This is a base vault for extending and playing **Generations in the Dark**, a Forged in the Dark game.

This vault uses several plugins to facilitate organization.
- [progress clocks](https://github.com/tokenshift/obsidian-progress-clocks) is used to represent clocks. If you don't have it, clocks will usually render as inline code blocks, like this; `clock 1 / 4`
