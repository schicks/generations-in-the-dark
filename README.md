This vault uses several plugins to facilitate organization.
- Breadcrumbs is used to help create a table of contents. If you don't have breadcrumbs, the yaml frontmatter still works fairly well.
- [progress clocks](https://github.com/tokenshift/obsidian-progress-clocks) is used to represent clocks. If you don't have it, clocks will usually render as inline code blocks, like this; `clock 1 / 4`
