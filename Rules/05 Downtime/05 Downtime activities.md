Between scores, your crew spends time at their liberty, attending to personal needs and side projects. These are called **downtime activities** (see the list below). During a downtime phase, each PC has time for **two downtime activities**. *When you're at war, each PC has time for only one.*

* Acquire Asset
* Long-Term Project
* Recover
* Reduce Heat
* Train
* Indulge Vice

You may choose the same activity more than once. You can only attempt actions that you're in a position to accomplish. If an activity is contingent on another action, resolve that action first.

A PC can make time for more than two activities, at a cost. **Each additional activity from the list costs** **1** **coin** or **1** **rep**. This reflects the time and resulting resource drain while you're "off the clock" and not earning from a score. When you complete a new score, you reset and get two "free" activities again.

Activities on the downtime list are limited; normal actions are not. During downtime, you can still go places, do things, make action rolls, gather information, talk with other characters, etc. In other words, only activities that are *on the list* are limited.

For any downtime activity, take **+1d** to the roll if a **friend** or **contact** helps you. After the roll, you may spend **coin** after the roll to improve the result level. **Increase the result level by one for each ****coin**** spent.** So, a **1-3** result becomes a **4** or a **5**, a **4/5** result becomes a **6**, and a **6** becomes a **critical**.

**GM:** If a player can't decide which downtime activity to pick, offer them a long-term project idea. You know what the player is interested in and what they like. Suggest a project that will head in a fun direction for them.

> "Remember how you had that weird vision at the altar to the forgotten gods? Yeah, do you want to get to the bottom of that? Okay, start a long-term project—six segments—called... 'Weird God Vibes.' What do you do to work on that?"

### Acquire asset

Gain temporary use of an **asset**:

* One special **item** or set of common items (enough for a gang of your Tier scale).
* A **cohort** (an expert or gang).
* A **vehicle**.
* A **service**. Transport from a smuggler or driver, use of a warehouse for temporary storage, legal representation, etc.

"Temporary use" constitutes one significant period of usage that makes sense for the asset—typically the duration of one score. An asset may also be acquired for "standby" use in the future. You might hire a gang to guard your lair, for example, and they'll stick around until after the first serious battle, or until a week goes by and they lose interest.

To acquire the asset, roll the crew's Tier. The result indicates the **quality** of the asset you get, using the crew's Tier as the base. **1-3**: Tier -1, **4/5**: Tier, **6**: Tier +1, **critical**: Tier +2. You can spend **coin** to raise the result of this roll beyond **critical** by spending **2** **coin** per additional Tier level added.

The GM may set a **minimum quality** level that must be achieved to acquire a particular asset. For example, if you want to get a set of Warden uniforms and masks, you'd need to acquire a Tier IV asset. A lower result won't do.

If you acquire the same asset again, you get **+1d** to your roll. If you continue to re-acquire an asset every time it's used, you can effectively rent it indefinitely.

Alchemicals, poisons, bombs, and dangerous gadgets are highly restricted. When you acquire one of these items (rather than crafting it yourself), you take **+2** **heat**.

If you want to acquire an asset permanently, you can either gain it as a crew upgrade or work on it as a **long-term project** to set up a permanent acquisition.

> Zamira the Whisper is a duelist in the Iruvian style, and would like a fine sword to add to her permanent items. Her player starts a long-term project: "Get My Family Sword Back from the Pawn Shop." The GM says this is an 8-clock (she can work on it by **Consorting** or **Swaying** the pawn shop owner or maybe rolling her lifestyle level to represent small payments).

### Long-term project

When you work on a long-term project (either a brand new one, or an already existing one), describe what your character does to advance the project clock, and roll one of your actions. Mark segments on the clock according to your result: **1-3**: one segment, **4/5**: two segments, **6**: three segments, **critical**: five segments.

A long-term project can cover a wide variety of activities, like doing research into an arcane ritual, investigating a mystery, establishing someone's trust, courting a new friend or contact, changing your character's vice, and so on.

Based on the goal of the project, the GM will tell you the clock(s) to create and suggest a method by which you might make progress.

In order to work on a project, you might first have to achieve the means to pursue it—which can be a project in itself. For example, you might want to make friends with a member of the City Council, but you have no connection to them. You could first work on a project to **Consort** in their circles so you have the opportunity to meet one of them. Once that's accomplished, you could start a new project to form a friendly relationship.

### Recover

When you recover, you seek treatment and heal your harm. You might visit a physicker who can stitch your wounds and soothe your mind with anatomical science or a witch who specializes in healing charms and restorative alchemy. If you don't have a contact or fellow PC who can provide treatment, you can use the **acquire asset** activity to gain access to a healer, who can provide service for the whole crew.

Recovery is like a long-term project. Your healer rolls (**Tinker** for a PC with the **Physicker** special ability or the **quality** level of an NPC) and then you mark a number of segments on your **healing clock**. **1-3**: one segment, **4/5**: two segments, **6**: three segments, **critical**: five segments.

When you fill your healing clock, reduce each instance of harm on your sheet by one level, then clear the clock. If you have more segments to mark, they "roll over."

@TODO add clock p99

> Cross has two injuries: a level 3 "Shattered Right Leg" and level 1 "Battered." During downtime, he gets treatment from Quellyn, a witch friend of the crew's Whisper. Quellyn is a competent healer, so the GM says quality 2 makes sense. The player rolls 2d to recover and gets a **6**: three segments on the healing clock. He decides to spend 1 **coin** to improve the result to a **critical** to get five segments instead. Four segments fill the clock—all of Cross's harm is reduced by one level, then he clears the clock and marks one more segment. His level 3 harm "Shattered Right Leg" is reduced to level 2 harm. His level 1 harm "Battered" is reduced to zero and goes away. Cross is left with one injury on his sheet: level 2 "Broken Leg."

You may heal yourself if you have the **Physicker** special ability, but you take 2 stress when you do so. You can also choose to simply tough it out and attempt to heal without any treatment—in this case, take 1 stress and roll 0d.

Note that it's the recovering character that takes the recovery action. Healing someone else does not cost a downtime activity for the healer.

Whenever you suffer new harm, clear any ticks on your healing clock.

### Reduce heat

Say what your character does to reduce the **heat** level of the crew and make an action roll. Maybe you **Consort** with your friend who's a officer and she arranges for a few incriminating Watch reports to disappear. Or maybe you **Command** the fear of the local citizens so they're afraid to snitch.

Reduce **heat** according to the result: **1-3**: one, **4/5**: two, **6**: three, **critical**: five.

### Train

When you spend time in training, **mark 1 xp** on the xp track for an **attribute** or **playbook** advancement. If you have the appropriate crew Training upgrade unlocked, mark **+1 xp** (2 total). See **Crew Upgrades**, for more information. *You can train a given xp track only once per downtime.*

### Indulge vice

Visit your **vice purveyor** to relieve **stress**. See the next section for details.

---

### VICE ROLL

 Roll dice equal to your **Lowest Attribute** rating.

Clear stress equal to your highest die result. If you clear more stress levels than you had marked, you ***overindulge***. *If you do not or cannot indulge your vice during downtime, you take stress equal to your **trauma**.*

---

## Stress Relief

Your characters are a special lot. They defy the powers-that-be and dare to prey on those who are considered to be their betters. They push themselves further than ordinary people are willing to go. But this comes at a cost. Their life is one of constant stress. Inevitably, each turns to the seduction of a **vice** in order to cope.

A character's vice is their obsession. But with this indulgence comes relief from stress and the ability to once again face the overwhelming challenge of their daring life.

## Indulging Your Vice

When you indulge your vice, you clear some stress from your character's stress track. Say how your character indulges their vice, including which **purveyor of vice** they use to satisfy their needs.  This indulgence takes time, so it can only be done when the crew has **downtime**. Alternately, you may choose to release your character to be "lost in their vice" during a game session, allowing them to indulge off-camera while you play a different PC. A gang member, friend, or contact of the crew might be created as an alternate character to play, thus fleshing out the landscape of PCs.

You roll to find out how much stress relief your character receives. A vice roll is like a resistance roll in reverse—rather than gaining stress levels, you clear stress levels. The effectiveness of your indulgence depends upon your character's worst attribute rating. It's their weakest quality (**Insight**, **Prowess**, or **Resolve**) that is most in thrall to vice.

Make an **attribute roll** using your character's lowest attribute rating (if there's a tie, that's fine—simply use that rating). **Clear stress equal to the highest die result.**

### Overindulgence

If your vice roll clears more stress levels than you had marked, you overindulge. A vice is not a reliable, controllable habit. It's a risk—and one that can drive your character to act against their own best interests.

When you overindulge, you make a bad call because of your vice—in acquiring it or while under its influence. To bring the effect of this bad decision into the game, select an overindulgence from the list:

* **Attract Trouble**. Select or roll an additional **entanglement**.
* **Brag** about your exploits. **+2** **heat**.
* **Lost**. Your character vanishes for a few weeks. Play a different character until this one returns from their bender. When your character returns, they've also healed any harm they had.
* **Tapped**. Your current purveyor cuts you off. Find a new source for your vice.

### Ignoring your vice

If you do not or cannot indulge your vice during a downtime phase, you take stress equal to your **trauma**. If you don't have any **trauma**, you're free to ignore your vice. It doesn't have a hold over you (yet).

### Roleplaying & XP

Along with your character's heritage and background, their vice tells us what kind of person they are. This obsession impacts their motivations, goals, and behavior. When you ponder what your character might do or say next, you can always consider their vice to help you think of something. As an added benefit, by playing to the nature of your character's vice, you earn xp at the end of the session.

## NPC & faction downtime

NPCs and factions also do things when the PCs have downtime. The GM **advances their project clocks** and chooses a downtime maneuver or two for each faction that they're interested in at the moment. Choose any maneuver that makes sense for that faction to pursue. For example:

* Seize a claim or increase hold, make an enemy vulnerable, or reduce the hold of a vulnerable enemy.
* Gather information on the PCs (may be opposed by a PC roll) or another subject.
* Achieve a short-term goal they're in position to accomplish.
* Acquire a new asset.
* Call in a favor from another faction.
* Employ political pressure or threats to force someone's hand.

**GM:** Choose downtime maneuvers and advance clocks for the factions you're interested in right now. Don't worry about the rest. Later, when you turn your attention to a faction you've ignored for a while, go ahead and give them several downtime phases and project clock ticks to "catch up" to current events.

If you're not sure how far to progress a faction's clock, make a fortune roll using their Tier as the base trait, modified up or down depending on the opposition or circumstances. Tick 1 segment for a 1-3 result, 2 segments for a 4/5 result, 3 segments for a 6 result, or 5 segments for a **critical** result.

When factions do things that are known in the criminal underworld, **tell the players about it** through one of their **friends** or **contacts** or **vice purveyors**. These rumors and bits of gossip can lead to future scores and opportunities for the PCs.
