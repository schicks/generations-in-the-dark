## Special Abilities

-  **Biohacker**: When you invent or craft a creation with biological features, take +1 result level to your roll. You begin with one special formula already known. 
- **Scientist**: During downtime, you get two ticks to distribute among any long term project clocks that involve investigation or learning a new formula or design plan.
- **Roboticist**: When you invent or craft a creation with robotic features, take +1 result level to your roll. You begin with one special design already known. 
- **Fortitude**: You may expend your special armor to resist a consequence of fatigue, weakness, or chemical effects, or to push yourself when working with technical skill or handling biologicals. 
- **Ghost Ward**: You know how to Wreck an area with alien substances and methods so it is either anathema or enticing to ghosts (your choice). 
- **Granny**: You can Tinker with bones, blood, and bodily humours to treat wounds or stabilize the dying. You may study a malady or corpse. Everyone in your crew gets +1d to their healing treatment rolls. 
- **Silencer**: When you Wreck, the work is much quieter than it should be and the damage is hidden from casual inspection. 
- **Venomous**: Choose a drug or poison (from your bandolier stock) to which you have become immune. You can push yourself to secrete it through your skin or saliva or exhale it as a vapor.
