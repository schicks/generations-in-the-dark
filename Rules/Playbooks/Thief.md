## Special Abilities

- **Infiltrator**: You are not affected by **quality** and **tier** when you bypass security measures
- **Ambush**: When you attack from hiding or spring a trap, you get **+1d**
- **Daredevil**: When you roll a desparate action, you get **+1d** to your roll if you also take **-1d** to any resistance rolls for the consequences.

	- move through the void with the control of a ghost

- **Shadow**: You may expend your **special armor** to resist a consequence from detection or security measures, or to **push yourself** for a feat of athletics or stealth.
