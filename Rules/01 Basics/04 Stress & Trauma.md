## Stress

Player characters in *Blades in the Dark* have a special reserve called **stress**. When they suffer a consequence that they don't want to accept, they can take stress instead. The result of the **resistance roll** determines how much stress it costs to avoid a bad outcome.

*During a knife fight, Daniel's character, Cross, gets stabbed in the chest. Daniel rolls his **Prowess** rating to resist, and gets a **2**. It costs 6 stress, minus 2 (the result of the resistance roll) to resist the consequences. Daniel marks off 4 stress and describes how Cross survives.*

*The GM rules that the harm is reduced by the resistance roll, but not avoided entirely. Cross suffers level 2 harm ("Chest Wound") instead of level 3 harm ("Punctured Lung").*

## Pushing Yourself

You can use stress to push yourself for greater performance. For each bonus you choose below, take **2 stress** (each can be chosen once for a given action):

* Add **+1d** to your roll. (This may be used for an action roll or downtime roll or any other kind of roll where extra effort would help you)
* Add **+1 level** to your effect.
* Take action when you're incapacitated.

## Trauma

When a PC marks their last stress box, they suffer a level of **trauma**. When you take **trauma**, circle one of your **trauma conditions** like *Cold*, *Reckless*, *Unstable*, etc. They're all described in the next section.

When you suffer **trauma**, you're taken out of action. You're "left for dead" or otherwise dropped out of the current conflict, only to come back later, shaken and drained. When you return, **you have zero stress** and your vice has been satisfied for the next downtime.

**Trauma conditions are permanent**. Your character acquires the new personality quirk indicated by the condition, and can earn xp by using it to cause trouble. **When you mark your fourth trauma condition**, your character cannot continue as a daring scoundrel. You must retire them to a different life or send them to prison to take the fall for the crew's **wanted level**.

### Trauma Conditions

* **Cold**: You're not moved by emotional appeals or social bonds.
* **Haunted**: You're often lost in reverie, reliving past horrors, seeing things.
* **Obsessed**: You're enthralled by one thing: an activity, a person, an ideology.
* **Paranoid**: You imagine danger everywhere; you can't trust others.
* **Reckless**: You have little regard for your own safety or best interests.
* **Soft**: You lose your edge; you become sentimental, passive, gentle.
* **Unstable**: Your emotional state is volatile. You can instantly rage, or fall into despair, act impulsively, or freeze up.
* **Vicious**: You seek out opportunities to hurt people, even for no good reason.
