## PC Advancement

Each player keeps track of the experience points (**xp**) that their character earns.

During the game session, mark xp:

* When you make a **desperate action roll**. Mark 1 xp in the attribute for the action you rolled. For example, if you roll a desperate **Skirmish** action, you mark xp in **Prowess***.* When you roll in a **group action** that's desperate, you also mark xp.

At the end of the session, review the **xp triggers** on your character sheet. For each one, mark 1 xp if it happened at all, or mark 2 xp if it happened a lot during the session. The xp triggers are:

* **Your playbook-specific xp trigger**. For example, the Cutter's is *"Address a challenge with violence or coercion."* To "address a challenge," your character should attempt to overcome a tough obstacle or threat. It doesn't matter if the action is successful or not. You get xp either way.
* **You expressed your beliefs, drives, heritage, or background.** Your character's beliefs and drives are yours to define, session to session. Feel free to tell the group about them when you mark xp.
* **You struggled with issues from your vice or traumas**. Mark xp for this if your vice tempted you to some bad action or if a trauma condition caused you trouble. Simply indulging your vice doesn't count as struggling with it (unless you **overindulge**).

You may mark end-of-session xp on any xp tracks you want (any attribute or your playbook xp track).

When you fill an xp track, clear all the marks and take an **advance**. When you take an advance from your playbook track, you may choose an additional **special ability**. When you take an advance from an attribute, you may add an **additional action dot** to one of the actions under that attribute.

> Nadja is playing a Hound. At the end of the session, she reviews her xp triggers and tells the group how much xp she's getting. She rolled two desperate **Hunt** actions during the session, so she marked 2 xp on her **Insight** xp track. She addressed several challenges with tracking or violence, so she marks 2 xp for that. She expressed her Iruvian heritage many times when dealing with the Red Sashes, so she takes 2 xp for that. She also showcased her character's beliefs, but 2 xp is the maximum for that category, so she doesn't get any more. She didn't struggle with her vice or traumas, so no xp there. That's 4 xp at the end of the session. She decides to put it all in her **Insight** xp track. This fills the track, so she adds a new action dot in **Hunt**.

You can also earn xp by **training** during downtime. When you train, mark xp in one of your attributes or in your playbook. A given xp track can be trained only once per downtime phase.

## Crew Advancement

At the end of the session, review the crew xp triggers and mark 1 crew xp for each item that occurred during the session. If an item occurred multiple times or in a major way, mark 2 crew xp for it. The crew xp triggers are:

* **Your crew-specific xp trigger**. For example, the Smugglers' is *"Execute a smuggling operation or acquire new clients or contraband sources."* If the crew successfully completed an operation from this trigger, mark xp.
* **Contend with challenges above your current station.** If you tangled with higher Tiers or more dangerous opposition, mark xp for this.
* **Bolster your crew's reputation or develop a new one.** Review your crew's reputation. Did you do anything to promote it? Also mark xp if you developed a new reputation for the crew.
* **Express the goals, drives, inner conflict, or essential nature of the crew.** This one is very broad! Essentially, did anything happen that highlighted the specific elements that make your crew unique?

**When you fill your crew advancement tracker**, clear the marks and take a new **special ability** or mark **two crew upgrade boxes**.

> For example, when a crew of Assassins earns a crew advance, they could take a new special ability, like **Predators**. Or they could mark two upgrades, like **Ironhook Contacts** and **Resolve** **Training**.

Say how you've obtained this new ability or upgrades for the crew. *Where did it come from? How does it become a new part of the crew?*

### Profits

Every time the crew advances, **each PC gets stash** equal to the crew Tier+2, to represent profits generated by the crew as they've been operating.
