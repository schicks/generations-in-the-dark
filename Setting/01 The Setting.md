The game takes place in the dark void of interstellar space aboard the generation ship [[Damaged Starship]].The ship is under constant assault from endless waves of [[Ghosts]], held back only by the [[Polarized Hull]]. While there is extremely advanced technology aboard the ship, its use is extremely limited due to the field generated by defenses against the ghosts. The ship is a warren of tight metal tunnels and cramped rooms, with people living anywhere they can.

You live in a starship that has been in flight for hundreds of years, but is still hundreds of years from its destination. You are besieged by ghosts, and if the ship has to hold any more people you'll be running out of air. You will die here. But that doesn't mean you can't die wealthy.

As in Blades, the goal here is to create a pressure cooker, keeping the stakes as high as possible.
