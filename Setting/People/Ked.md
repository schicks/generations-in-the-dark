## Demographics
Ked, first and foremost, looks bored. Disinterested. Detached. He is well into his 30s, of average height and lean in appearance from the mixture of training and desperation that comes with hurtling through space to his doom. His clothes were clean and well kept at one point, when he thought his job was worth doing before slowly realizing there were other ways to succeed. 

### Background
Ked grew up fascinated by the idea of the ships, moving through space towards a new home and the opportunities it presented for humanity. As the years went by, he thought he wanted to help see this vision through and that keeping the peace amongst the dissenters of the ship was righteous. As crews continued to pop up to their own ends and the work became increasingly hopeless, Ked gave in to a new approach. One that would see his vision replaced with his survival and prosperity. He began to turn his training in the [[Ship Defense Corps|SDC]] to his own ends, finding those who would help him in return and forgetting his own faults through violence and indulgence and away from the [[Union]]

Knew Laramie when Ked was in SDC, [[Laramie]] was in Nav. Laramie drifted from grace and Ked sort of followed as they both descended into the criminal life, hoping that it would work out better together. Both went to [[Dr. Elmo Fisher]] for jobs running things, before realizing he was insane, but could be useful to further their own trials. Dr Fisher's shadow turned out to be a young girl, eerily fascinated with his work, known as [[Astrea]]
