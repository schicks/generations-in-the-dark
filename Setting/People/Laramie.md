## Demographics
Almost entirely nondescript physically, Laramie sticks out only due to their size. They are tall and thick, though of uniform shape. In fact, some might say they have a difficult time recalling anything about Laramie's appearance.

### Background
Laramie passed the [[Civil Aptitude Test|CAT]] with flying colors and was brought into [[Navigation]], where they were given a higher education. After some time working in Navigation, Laramie grew bored and used some of their social graces to dig deeper into the group's plans. Upon finding out how focused Nav was on taking care of their own interests, they fed some information to the SDC to cause chaos and dropped out. Ever since, Laramie has been working small jobs and doing their best to stay under the radar.

### Heritage
Laramie was born to a working class family, most of which were relegated to minor ship maintenance. Nearly everyone in the family is in the [[Union]], which appeared to be a preordained result for Laramie until they aced the CAT. Ever the chaos agent, Laramie eagerly left the family to join Navigation and spurned their brother, [[Scully]] in the process.Â 

Now that Laramie has 'returned to Earth', they have attempted to make peace and join the Union for protection and better wages. Scully has consistently been a barrier to entry as he still feels that Laramie is entirely out for themselves and in direct contradiction to the Union's motivations. This has changed their relationship from simmering tension to a boiling feud.
