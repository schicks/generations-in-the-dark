The launch ring is suspended in the middle of the hab ring, close enough to the center that gravity is negligible. From that position cargo hauled up the cable elevators can relatively easily and safely be launched by shuttle. As launching or landing a vehicle on the hab ring is extremely dangerous, the launch ring is effectively the only way between starships. It is tightly controlled by the [[Spacers Union]].
