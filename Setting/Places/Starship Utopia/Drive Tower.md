The drive tower is the propulsion system for [[Starship Utopia|Utopia]]. Suspended at the center of the ring, it contains the fusion drive that flung Utopia from earth out into the dark. The heavy shielding necessary to protect [[Navigation|nav crew]] from radiation from the fusion drive meant that it also now contains some of the only functional computers left on the ship. It is only accessible from the rest of the ship by elevator.
