[[Max Malone]] is looking for a crew to help seize control of the elevators heading into the [[Drive Tower]] as territory for the [[Spacers Union]]. At the same time, the [[Ship Defense Corps|SDC]] is looking for someone to get rid of Max.

## hooks
- Does the crew have a union contact who could refer them to Max?
- Does the crew have an SDC contact who could hire them to deal with Max?

## if they don't interfere
Max could make an assault on the elevators unassisted and fail, pushing up the SDC assault on the launch ring and losing progress on taking the drive tower. Alternately, Max could work with a rival crew to successfully take the elevators, creating an alliance between the spacers union and our scoundrels enemies.

## questions
- Does the spacers union wrest control of the drive tower elevators from the SDC?
- Can the elevators be taken without violence?

## conclusion

[[Fisher's Price]] dealt with Max for the SDC, aborting his attempt on the elevators. This reduced progress towards the spacers sabotaging the drive tower, and increased progress towards the SDC seizing the launch ring.
