#score
 A [[The Coven|Coven]] clinic has been attracting a lot of customers. Most of them can't pay, but some of them can. Convince them that they can afford to pay you for protection. 
## hooks
- A gang cohort tries and fails to intimidate the clinic on their own
- A character needs an ingredient the clinic has and notices how valuable this could be

## if they don't interfere
Start a clock for "CADMUS seizes coven clinic". This is still a risk even after the score.

## questions
- What is the clinic providing?
- Who frequents the clinic who would rather that information not be public?

## conclusion
