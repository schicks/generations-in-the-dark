The [[Ship Defense Corps|SDC]] have started to take a little too much interest in what the crew has been doing. Give them something else to pay attention to.
## hooks
- the [[Spacers Union]] could make a lot of trouble for the SDC
-  [[The Coven]] could be exposed as planning a coup
- A [[CADMUS (Collective for the Advancement of Directed Morphogenetic Synthesis)|CADMUS]] lab could have a leak

## if they don't interfere

Start a clock for "SDC investigation into the crew". When it fills, someone gets arrested.

## questions
- Who will the crew deflect attention on to, and how will they react?

## conclusion
