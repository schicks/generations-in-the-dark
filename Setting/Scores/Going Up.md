[[Max Malone]] is looking for a crew to help seize control of the elevators heading into the [[Drive Tower]] as territory for the [[Spacers Union]].

## hooks
- Does the crew have a union contact who could refer them to Max?

## if they don't interfere
Max could make an assault on the elevators unassisted and fail, pushing up the SDC assault on the launch ring and losing progress on taking the drive tower. Alternately, Max could work with a rival crew to successfully take the elevators, creating an alliance between the spacers union and our scoundrels enemies.

## questions
- Does the spacers union wrest control of the drive tower elevators from the SDC?
- Can the elevators be taken without violence?

## conclusion
