## Background
Once known as the [[Foundation For Municipal Health]], this organization was borne from the need to supply medical care to generations of people. Over population becoming a concern the organization shifted focus from conventional medicine and extending human life, and focused on more eldritch research. There are extra test subjects afterall.. On the discovery of a synthetic mutagenic fungus, there was extensive research in its use in augmenting human capabilities and its side effects. Some seek immortality so they may experience what awaits in orbit of the [[Final Star]], while others examine unlocking the full potential of the human brain and cybernetics

[[The Coven]] opposes their silo. Their knowledge belongs to the people, and bears wider use and experimentation. They extensively use what scraps of secrets they have uncovered, primarily from the sole few who have 'defected' to their cause.

## Turf
The location of all parts of [[The Academy]] are not common knowledge, hidden from the public to avoid fear of what their work comprises and to reduce reprisal. These include residences, although some choose to reside in the [[Garden District]]

## NPCs
[[Dr. Xavier Baleford]] - Working on the secret for immortality, a cessation of aging entirely. Initial trials have been deemed safe enough that he has seen a small cohort survive abnormally long. His research is nearly at a breakthrough.

[[Dr. Angeline Angleheart]] - Working on a cure for [[Psychogenic Encephalopathy]], however the lab is about to leak, what escapes into the population?

[[Dr. Aaron Mudd]] Someone who is working on naturally grown manipulators and augmentations, who needs an extra hand when you have three!
