## Background
Technically the Dockworkers Chapter of the [[Union]], the spacers are among the most powerful workers on the ship and have an outsized influence on union operations overall. Without trained spacer techs, moving between [[Starship Utopia|Utopia]] and [[Damaged Starship]] is basically impossible.
## Turf
Most of the [[Launch Ring]]

## NPCs
- [[Anton]], chapter president
- [[Max Malone]], lead enforcer

## Notable Assets

## Situation
Anton knows that the upcoming [[Decel Burn]] would mean that spacers are basically dead weight, since moving between ships won't be possible once the burn starts. They're fighting for a contract to guarantee retraining and job security, but [[Intership Council]] isn't budging. The chapter is preparing for a strike.

Max doesn't believe that will go anywhere, and is using it as cover (without Anton's knowledge) to work on preventing the decel burn altogether.
