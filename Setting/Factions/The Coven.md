## Background
They call themselves the Coalition for Biomorphological Equality, but to anyone else they are the Coven, a disorganized group aggressively bent on the democratization of biomodification and freedom to use morphogenic compounds. Those cogent enough often stage violent protests, of [[CADMUS]] exclusive research. The [[Ship Defense Corps]] have been known to break up such altercations, by whatever means necessary.

## Turf
They have small encampments in various parts of the ship but the largest by far are [[The Boroughs]] A mire of fungal growths and makeshift housing, interspersed with the occasional 'clinic'. 

## NPCs
[["Doc" ]] - Once an esteemed surgeon, left the academy to share his knowledge with the people. Not nearly as much of a zealot, but does their best to care for those whom experience more dire consequences of experimentation.

[[Ursula]] - Youthful escaped test subject whom found a home amongst those who helped her get by with the side effects of brutal mind research. Afflicted with [[Psychogenic Encephalopathy]] which gives light psionic ability but is experiencing a deteriorating psychosis.

[[Bones]] A scrapper who among them knows who pays the best for biological scrap
## Notable Assets
A cache of weapons and resources, a nearly clean med-bay, and a bio bomb
## Situation
Tensions are rising between the Coven and CADMUS and little progress has been made to change policy. The people are ready to make their voices heard... Work is being done to create a serum that might give an organized assault a fighting edge, but some refuse to hold their breath.
