## Background
They call themselves the Coalition for Biomorphological Equality, but to anyone else they are the Coven, a disorganized group aggressively bent on the democratization of biomodification and freedom to use morphogenic compounds. Those cogent enough often stage violent protests, of [[The Coven|CADMUS]] exclusive research. The [[Ship Defense Corps]] have been known to break up such altercations, by whatever means necessary.

## Turf
They have small encampments in various parts of the ship but the largest by far are [[The Boroughs]] A mire of fungal growths and makeshift housing, interspersed with the occasional 'clinic'. These surround [[The Academy]]

## NPCs
[["Doc" ]] - Once an esteemed surgeon, left the academy to share his knowledge with the people. Not nearly as much of a zealot, but does their best to care for those whom experience more dire consequences of experimentation.

[[Ursula]] - Youthful escaped test subject whom found a home amonst those who helped her get by with the side effects of brutal mind research. Afflicted with [[Psychogenic Encephalopathy]] which gives light psionic ability but is experiencing a deteriorating psychosis.

[[Bones]] A scrapper who among them knows who pays the best for biological scrap
