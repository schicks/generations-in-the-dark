## Background
Lots of jobs need to get done on the ship to keep it running. Most of the people who do those jobs are nobodies, with no power. The only way for those nobodies to get the things they need and the respect they deserve is to stand together. 

That's the ideal anyway. In practice, it's a lot better to be at the top of the union than at the bottom.
## Turf
- small meeting halls in each parish
- most of the [[Launch Ring]] through the [[Spacers Union]]
- Headquarters in [[East Wind Parish]]

## NPCs
- [[Rosie Starborn]], representative to the [[Intership Council]]
- [[Devin]], head of dues collections
- [[Perry]], opposition leader running against Rosie in the upcoming union election

## Notable Assets
- Strike threats; the union doesn't own much, but they have stopped all maintenance work before and could do it again

## Situation

Rosie has been running the union for a long time now, but more and more people are feeling like the dues aren't getting them what they used to. Perry is channeling that energy into an opposition campaign, claiming he can get more out of the council. Meanwhile, [[Lucy Baleford]] on the council is stoking the flames, cracking down on strikes with her SDC contacts and pushing out propaganda about how all the union does is hurt the ship and take from its members.
