## Background
Navigation is one of the oldest groups aboard the ship, stretching back all the way to [[Launch Day]]. They recruit from the rest of the population based on the [[Civil Aptitude Test]], and are seen as a prestigious and competitive posting. Families with enough capital often buy their children postings, which means Nav is never short on resources.

There is internal tension between those who bought their posting, who see Nav as a prestigious but cushy hobby with no real work to speak of, and those who were recruited, who do most of the actual work of tracking the ships location and calculating when the [[Decel Burn]] should begin.
## Turf
[[Flawless Starship Drive Tower]] is controlled by some of the only surviving computers. While some Navis are so obsessed with their work that they live full time in the drive towers, most (and nearly all of those who bought postings) live in the [[Garden District]]. 
## NPCs
[[Milo Yannis]] comes from a powerful family, but insisted on taking the [[Civil Aptitude Test|CAT]] and earning his position as a navi. He has the nominal rank of commander of [[Flawless Starship]], but not a lot of real authority to back it up.

[[Thane Horizon]] is the heir to one of the most powerful families aboard the [[Flawless Starship]]. He is a high priest of [[Ghost Cult]], and quietly scheming to prevent the [[Decel Burn]] altogether.
## Notable Assets

Navigation computers, [[Flawless Starship]] fusion drive, [[Observatory Bell]]s scattered all over the ship. 
## Situation
In order to slow down enough to end in orbit of [[Final Star]], the [[Decel Burn]] is imminent. However, Nav does not control [[Damaged Starship Drive Tower]], and are not at all certain that if they ordered people to prepare for decel that [[Ship Defense Corps]] would back them up. [[Thane Horizon]] is scheming to prevent the [[Decel Burn]] altogether by untethering the fusion drive and abandoning it to the [[Ghosts]]. 
## Clocks
